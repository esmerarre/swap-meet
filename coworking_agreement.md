# Coworking Agreement

Talk through each section with your partner. Add notes on what you discussed and agreed upon in each section. At the bottom, type your names to sign off on your agreement.

## Accessibility Needs
*What does each team member need access to in order to succeed and show up the best they can?*

We need the collab invites and be able clone on our local machines. Good communication.

## Collaboration vs. Individual Work Expectations
*Clarify your collaboration expectations - does your group want to write code together all of the time? Or divide work to do independently, then come together to share accomplishments? What tools and technologies can help your collaboration?*

We will take time to code together and individually. We will work together during the in-class corworking sessions and optional office hours if needed.

## Learning Style
*How does each team member learn best in project settings?*

Amanda prefers a "show and tell" approach to learning and working on presenting code and learning to see how the code works. Esmeralda learns best by working through the problems and learning as they go while encountering problems and understanding how to fix those problems.


## Preferred Feedback Style
*How does each team member best receive feedback?*

We can edit and review the other persons code but would like to know why the changes were made and be able to communicate with one another about when we make any changes or explain why the changes were made.

## One Team Communication Skill to Improve
*What is a teamwork-related skill you want to work on?*

Work on being able to explain code. Learning how to respect partners time and give them space and not rush through coding everything at once. 

## Optional: Other agreements
*Other co-working agreements that were not captured in the above sections.*

We agree to review our work and can do the push/pull when we finish the project.
